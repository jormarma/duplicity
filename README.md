# My Rust Project

This is a basic Rust project setup. 

## Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `src/main.rs`: This is the main file of the Rust application. It contains the main function which is the entry point of the application.
- `tests/lib.rs`: This file is used for integration tests in Rust. It contains test functions that test the functionality of the code in the `src` directory.
- `Cargo.toml`: This is the manifest file for Rust's package manager, Cargo. It contains information about the package, its dependencies, and other metadata.
